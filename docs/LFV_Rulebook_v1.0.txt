LFV v1.0 RULEBOOK
Logical Fact Validation - Public, Deterministic, Publish-Ready
Version: LFV-RB-v1.0
Status: Frozen for Phase I

1. Scope & Intent
LFV outputs logic-structure labels for individual claims. It answers:
"Can this claim logically stand as written?"
LFV does not decide policy, morality, motive, or what anyone should believe or do.

2. Inputs (Strict)
- One claim, pasted verbatim (single sentence or short paragraph).
- No paraphrasing, summarizing, or interpretation before analysis.

3. Outputs (Only These)
Final Labels
- PASS: logically possible and properly scoped for its claim type.
- FAIL: violates a logical constraint (impossibility, contradiction, invariant violation).
- UNKNOWN: well-formed but undecidable from logic alone without additional data.
- UNDERDETERMINED: ambiguous (variables undefined or terms overloaded).
- OVERCLAIMED: scope exceeds what the evidence/wording can support.

Flags (Non-verdict)
- Absolute Language Flag
- Scope Risk Flag (Low/Medium/High)
- Bias Risk Flag
- Low Falsifiability Flag

LFV may include a brief Falsifiability Statement ("This claim would be falsified if...").

4. Prohibited Content (Never Output)
- Motive inference (e.g., "money grab," "lied," "propaganda").
- Calls to action or policy guidance.
- Emotional adjectives or ridicule.
- Ranking people, outlets, or institutions.
- Suppression, blocking, or feed manipulation recommendations.

5. Deterministic Pipeline (Must Run in Order)

Gate A - Variable Definition Gate
If key terms map to multiple variables (e.g., boy/girl, safe, works, good):
- List distinct interpretations, OR
- Output UNDERDETERMINED until the variable is explicit.

Gate B - Claim Type Gate
Classify exactly one:
1) Invariant/Tautology (logic/math/thermodynamics-type constraints)
2) Empirical Bounded (observations within time/place)
3) Universal Empirical ("always/never/all")
4) Predictive (future outcomes)
5) Normative ("should/must")

Rules:
- Normative -> OUT OF SCOPE -> label UNDERDETERMINED (normative).
- Universal Empirical -> trigger Absolute Language Flag.

Gate C - Constraint Checks
Test five constraints:
1) Internal Consistency (no contradictions)
2) Causality Order (causes precede effects)
3) Conservation/Feasibility (no creation from nothing; invariant limits)
4) Scale Sanity (magnitudes/timeframes not self-contradictory)
5) Dependency Validity (required conditions not omitted)

Any violated constraint -> FAIL.

Gate D - Scope vs Evidence Window
Assess mismatch between claim scope and implied/known evidence window.
- Broad scope + narrow window -> higher Scope Risk.
- Empirical claims cannot be upgraded to absolutes without invariants.

Unbounded absolutes -> OVERCLAIMED.

Gate E - Bias & Auditability (Logic-Only)
Do not assume bias. Flag whether bias is logically excludable.
- Opaque data/pipeline -> Bias Risk Flag.
- Independent, non-overlapping constraints may be noted as Redundancy (no scoring).

Gate F - Falsifiability Requirement
State what observation would falsify the claim.
- If none exists -> Low Falsifiability Flag (often -> UNKNOWN).

6. Absolute Language Handling
Words like always, never, all, none, proven, settled, unequivocal, guaranteed, harmless, causes:
- Trigger Absolute Language Flag.
- Force Scope Check.

Universal negatives may PASS only when grounded in invariants (e.g., thermodynamic impossibilities). Otherwise -> OVERCLAIMED.

7. Treatment of Measurement
- "Accurate" means within stated uncertainty, not perfection.
- Claims of zero bias in empirical systems -> FAIL (bias pathways are logically non-zero).

8. Reader Sovereignty
LFV provides structure, not belief. The reader interprets the label and decides next steps.

9. Versioning & Transparency
- Every LFV output must display Ruleset ID: LFV-RB-v1.0.
- Changes require a new version with a public changelog.
