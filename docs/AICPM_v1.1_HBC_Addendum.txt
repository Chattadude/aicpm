AICPM v1.1 ADDER - Headline-Body Consistency (HBC)
Status: Phase I extension proposal (structure-only)

Purpose
Preserve expectation integrity between headline and body without judging intent.

HBC belongs in AICPM (structure), not LFV (claim logic).

Deterministic pipeline
A) Headline expectation extraction
- Temporal implication: immediate/recent/historical/unspecified
- Event type
- Magnitude: numbers, absolutes
- Certainty language

B) Body grounding extraction
- Explicit dates
- Clarifiers (historical/archive/in YYYY)
- Corrections/reframing
- Disclosure timing (early vs late)

C) Alignment comparison across axes
- Temporal alignment (aligned/misaligned)
- Scope alignment
- Magnitude alignment
- Certainty alignment
- Context disclosure timing (early/late)

Output (nutrition-style, no intent labels)
Headline-Body Consistency (HBC)
- Temporal alignment: OK/MISALIGNED
- Scope alignment: OK/MISALIGNED
- Magnitude alignment: OK/MISALIGNED
- Certainty alignment: OK/REDUCED
- Disclosure timing: EARLY/LATE

Neutral advisory example
"Headline implies current event. Article describes historical event (1979)."

Non-goals
- No "clickbait" label
- No ranking or blocking
- No motive inference
