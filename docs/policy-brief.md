# Policy Brief: AICPM and Verifiable AI Content Disclosure

## Executive Summary

**AICPM (Authenticated AI Content Provenance Marking)** is a technical framework that enables **verifiable disclosure** of AI-generated text at the time of creation.

Rather than attempting to *detect* AI-generated content after publication, AICPM allows AI providers to **cryptographically attest** to the origin of their outputs in a way that can be independently verified by platforms, regulators, and the public.

AICPM is designed to support transparency objectives **without introducing censorship, surveillance, or centralized control**.

## The Policy Problem

AI-generated content is now widely used in journalism, education, research, and public communication. As use expands, policymakers face several challenges:

- Disclosure requirements lack a technical implementation standard  
- Detection-based approaches are unreliable and adversarial  
- Platform-level labels are non-portable and unverifiable  
- Overbroad solutions risk chilling speech or innovation  

There is currently **no neutral, auditable mechanism** that allows AI disclosure claims to be verified independently.

---

## What AICPM Provides

AICPM addresses this gap by enabling:

- **Creation-time disclosure** rather than post-hoc inference
- **Cryptographic verification** instead of probabilistic detection
- **Granular attribution** for mixed human–AI authorship
- **Platform-independent verification** (including offline)

Under AICPM, disclosure is a **technical fact**, not a platform assertion.

---

## What AICPM Does *Not* Do

To avoid unintended policy consequences, AICPM is intentionally limited in scope.

AICPM does **not**:
- Judge content truthfulness or quality
- Block, filter, or rank content
- Identify or track users
- Detect undisclosed AI usage
- Enforce compliance or penalties

AICPM supports disclosure without expanding regulatory or platform power.

---

## Alignment With Regulatory Goals

AICPM is compatible with emerging AI governance principles, including:

- Transparency and disclosure requirements  
- Auditability and accountability  
- Technology-neutral regulation  
- Proportionality and minimal intrusion  

By separating **technical disclosure** from **policy enforcement**, AICPM allows regulators to require *declaration* without mandating *detection* or *control mechanisms*.

## Risk Reduction and Civil Liberties

AICPM reduces common regulatory risks:

| Concern | AICPM Approach |
|------|---------------|
| False positives | Deterministic cryptographic verification |
| Surveillance | No user data, no tracking |
| Censorship | No enforcement capability |
| Vendor lock-in | Open, provider-agnostic design |
| Overreach | Disclosure-only scope |

This makes AICPM suitable for democratic, open-speech environments.

---

## International and Cross-Border Use

AICPM does not require:
- Central registries
- Jurisdiction-specific infrastructure
- Real-time network connectivity

As a result, it can be adopted across jurisdictions without fragmenting the web or requiring harmonized enforcement regimes.

---

## Role of Policymakers

Policymakers are **not asked to mandate AICPM**.

Instead, AICPM can serve as:
- A **reference architecture** for disclosure requirements
- A **technical option** for voluntary compliance
- A **baseline mechanism** for future standards

Regulators may reference AICPM as an example of **verifiable disclosure**, without endorsing a specific implementation.

---

## Status and Maturity

AICPM currently includes:
- Public specification
- Threat model
- Governance framework
- Reference verifier logic
- Editor and CMS integration guidance
- Interoperability examples

The project is open-source and designed for multi-stakeholder evolution.

---

## Summary

AICPM offers a **measured, technical response** to AI transparency challenges.

It avoids:
- Detection arms races
- Centralized trust
- Speech controls

And instead provides:
- Verifiable provenance
- Honest disclosure
- Platform neutrality

For policymakers seeking transparency without unintended consequences, AICPM represents a **low-risk, high-clarity option**.
