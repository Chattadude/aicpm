WHAT THIS IS / WHAT THIS IS NOT
Public Manifesto (Phase I)

What this is
- A logic-structure mirror for claims (LFV) plus a structure/provenance label for information (AICPM).
- A labeling layer that preserves reader choice.
- A system that makes scope, uncertainty, and falsifiability visible.

What this is not
- Not censorship.
- Not a ministry of truth.
- Not a political tool.
- Not a trust score or credibility ranker.
- Not a replacement for science.
- Not a system that tells you how to vote, think, or feel.

Non-negotiable commitments
- User choice: always opt-in.
- Transparency: rules are public and versioned.
- Neutral vocabulary: PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN/OVERCLAIMED/UNDERDETERMINED only.
- No motive inference: LFV cannot infer intent.
- No suppression: labeling only.

The promise
- If a claim is strong, it survives.
- If a claim is sloppy, the label shows where.
- The reader remains sovereign.
